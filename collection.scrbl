Rebellion provides several different types of collections. A @deftech{
 collection} is a container for values, like a @tech/reference{list} or a
@tech/reference{hash table}. Different types of collections have different
properties, for example @tech/reference{sets} are unordered and have no
duplicate elements. For advice on how to choose the right collection type, see
@secref["choosing-collections"].
