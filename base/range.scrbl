@title{Ranges}
@defmodule[rebellion/base/range]

A @deftech{range}, also called an @deftech{interval}, is a continuous set of
ordered values. Ranges have at most two bounds: an upper bound and a lower
bound. Either bound may be absent, in which case the range is @tech{unbounded}.
If a bound is present, it contains an endpoint value and an indication of
whether the bound is inclusive or exclusive.

@section{Range Data Model}

@defproc[(range? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
 A predicate for @tech{ranges}.}

@defproc[(range [lower-bound (or/c range-bound? unbounded?)]
                [upper-bound (or/c range-bound? unbounded?)]
                [#:comparator comparator comparator? real<=>])
         range?]{
 Constructs a @tech{range} encompassing all values between @racket[lower-bound]
 and @racket[upper-bound], when ordered according to @racket[comparator].

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (range (inclusive-bound 3) (exclusive-bound 7)))

 Either @racket[lower-bound] or @racket[upper-bound] may be the special @racket[
 unbounded] constant, indicating that the range is @tech{unbounded} on that end.
 A range may be unbounded on both ends, in which case the range encompasses all
 possible values (as long as they would be accepted by @racket[comparator]).

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (range (inclusive-bound 3) unbounded)
   (range unbounded (exclusive-bound 7))
   (range unbounded unbounded))

 If the range is not unbounded, then @racket[lower-bound] must not be greater
 than @racket[upper-bound] when compared with @racket[comparator].

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (eval:error (range (inclusive-bound 42) (exclusive-bound 17))))

 However, @racket[lower-bound] @emph{may} be equal to @racket[upper-bound], as
 long as at least one of the two bounds is inclusive. If both bounds are equal
 and inclusive, this constructs a @tech{singleton range} which contains only one
 value. If one of the bounds is exclusive, the constructed range is an @tech{
  empty range} that contains no values. If both bounds are exclusive, a contract
 violation is raised.

 @(examples
   #:eval (make-evaluator) #:once
   (range (inclusive-bound 5) (inclusive-bound 5))
   (range (inclusive-bound 18) (exclusive-bound 18))
   (eval:error (range (exclusive-bound 42) (exclusive-bound 42))))}

 One range @deftech{encloses} another range when the first range contains every

@defthing[range<=> (comparator/c range?)]{
 A @tech{comparator} that compares @tech{ranges}. Ranges are compared by first comparing their lower
 bounds and then comparing their upper bounds. One range is less than another if it contains smaller
 values than the other range. In the case that the minimum values contained by each range are
 equivalent, the smaller range is the range that contains fewer values (meaning the range that has a
 smaller upper bound). Ranges can only be compared if they use equal endpoint comparators, otherwise a
 contract exception is raised.

 Ranges only compare equivalent if they're equal. That is, the @racket[range<=>] comparator is
 @tech{consistent with equality}. Note that this means that some ranges are not equivalent even though
 they contain the same set of values. Specifically, any two empty ranges with always contain the same
 set of values (the empty set) but the ranges only compare equivalent if they have the same endpoints.
 This is only possible with empty ranges; two nonempty ranges that contain the same set of values are
 always equal and thus always compare equivalent.

 Returns the smallest range that @tech{encloses} both @racket[range1] and @racket[range2]. The ranges

 This operation is commutative, associative, and idempotent.

 is raised. In the case of two ranges that are adjacent but do not overlap, the resulting range is
 empty. This operation is commutative.
